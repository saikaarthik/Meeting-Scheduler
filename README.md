# Meeting Scheduler
 
## Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
The mobile application industry is rapidly advancing, with Android OS being the most widely used platform. Android, based on a Linux kernel, offers high flexibility and customization, making it dominant. Android applications are programmed in Java, supported by the Google Android SDK and existing Java IDEs. Cross-platform approaches ensure applications can be deployed across various platforms without platform-dependent coding.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current meeting scheduling methods lack user-friendly interfaces, fail to comprehensively consider participants' availability, and lack seamless calendar integration. This leads to scheduling conflicts, wasted time, and reduced productivity. A mobile application is needed to simplify scheduling, analyze availability, suggest optimal meeting times, and seamlessly integrate with calendars to streamline the scheduling process.

### Android Studio

Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. It offers features such as a flexible Gradle-based build system, a fast emulator, a unified environment for developing on all Android devices, code templates, extensive testing tools, and support for C++ and NDK.

### 1.4.1 Project Structure
Projects in Android Studio contain modules with source code and resource files, including Android app modules, library modules, and Google App Engine modules. Each app module contains manifest and java folders.
